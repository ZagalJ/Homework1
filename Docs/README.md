# Homework1
homework for week 1

This is the first homework that was given to us during this bootcamp.

I've come a long way and I feel like this meets most of the standars set.

The webpage meets accesibility standards, there's semantic HTML elements including; header, main and footer.

The elements now follow a logical structure. Images have alt attributes in all of them and it has a new title.
	
All the images and elements are properly displayed and there are no error when running the code.
